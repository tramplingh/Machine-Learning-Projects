Linear Regression Model: From Data to Prediction (Conceptual From-Scratch)

This repository presents a Multiple Linear Regression model, built with a focus on understanding the underlying concepts from first principles. It's designed to predict a target variable (like an Exam_Score) based on multiple input features (such as Hours_Studied and Attendance).

The project meticulously walks through each stage of building a predictive model, offering a clear explanation of what happens "behind the scenes."

The dataset I have used is Student Performance Factors from Kaggle. It's available in my repository or you can find it here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors

What You'll Find & Learn:

Data Collection & Processing: Understand how raw data is prepared for modeling. This includes loading data, initial inspection, handling missing values, converting different data types, and crucial feature selection based on correlations to identify the most impactful predictors.

Model Training Fundamentals: Dive deep into how a linear regression model learns. We explain the core idea of finding a "best-fit line" (or plane) by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE), an essential Loss Function. You'll also grasp the iterative process of Gradient Descent, which optimizes the model's parameters step-by-step.

Model Evaluation: Learn how to assess a model's performance on unseen data using key metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2).

Project Goal:

This project is ideal for students, beginners in machine learning, or anyone looking to solidify their understanding of linear regression's foundational mechanics. It emphasizes conceptual clarity, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application without relying on high-level library abstractions for the core algorithm.

Technologies Used:

Python: The primary language for implementation.

Pandas: For efficient data loading, manipulation, and processing.

NumPy: For numerical operations (often implicitly used by Pandas and for mathematical calculations).
